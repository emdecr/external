# Intro + Sections

Author: Emily Dela Cruz

_**What is this document? Why does it exist?**_

I have multiple Notes in my Evernote that reference things that have inspired me. They were scattered about, but I liked the idea of somewhat consolidating them. Fast forward to the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, I'm searching the internet for examples of self-reviews and I came across the [Buster Benson blog about and his personal 'codex vitae'](https://busterbenson.com/blog/2012/11-28-codex-vitae/) and his [public repo](https://github.com/busterbenson/public).

I'm using the bones of his project to start my own codex vitae.

I started this project on April 10th, 2020. Itâ€™s here to keep track of who I think I am, and how that changes over time. I've always loved patterns and making connections. This project will hopefully be a fun exercise in such. As with Buster's project, I'd also like this to be an invitiation for others to spark conversations with me about anything they find interesting and to also help keep me accountable.

Overall, I'm pretty internal. I wanted to externalize some of the rumblings in my brain.
